### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee. My research interests encompass various domains, including Text Style Transfer, Large Language Models, and Math Word Problem Solving. Before that, I got my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the UESTC, where I was supervised by Prof. Dai Bo. My undergraduate studies were also at UESTC, where I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences.
